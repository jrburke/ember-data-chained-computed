# ember-data-chained-computed

This is for an issue reported to ember-data here:


tests/unit/nested-computed-test.js file shows the issue.

The computed dependencies:

* Message.people
    * Message.recipientsById
        * Message.recipients.[]
        * Message.group.people.[]
            * Group.groupMembers.@each.roles

In Ember and Ember Data 3.5.0, an update to add a new groupMember to the Group does not result in Message.people updating. In 2.18 the update did occur, the test passes.
